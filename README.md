# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

The number one question we get here at Tweeter is: why am I 'Bat Person' automatically when using this app and more importantly, why are none of the tweets that I write made by me, Bat Person? Well, for one, Bat Person is human and enjoys tweeting sometimes so they deserve that ability. But second, there is a little Bat Person in us all; we are just giving that part of you a platform from which it can spew wisdom. When you submit a tweet, it does not get posted as Bat Person's tweet because we must keep Bat Person, and the Bat People within us all, anonymous. Enjoy.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
